# Snake Game
## Overview 
  This project is a simple Snake Game implemented using python programming and Turtle Library. The aim of the game is to control the snake with the arrow keys and eat the food that appears on the screen. Every time the bait is eaten, the snake gets bigger, faster and the score increases. If the snake touches the edges or its own body, the game is over. The game score is kept in a txt file, and even if the game is closed, the highest score is not reset when it is opened again.
